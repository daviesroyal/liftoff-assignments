# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app was designed by an equestrian, for equestrians. My trainer developed her own technique, and has clients all over the world, but has trouble training those clients through the technology available. 
The goal of this app is facilitate those relationships by providing an interface that lets owners track their horse's training sessions, track their own training goals, and receive feedback from their connected trainer.
### Features
- **User Login**: Users will be able to create accounts and login into the application. Each user will have a profile page.
- **Horse Profile**: Logged in users will be able to create horse objects that will appear in the user's "stable." These horse objects will have a general profile, a training profile, and a health profile containing any relevant text, pictures, videos, files, and dates.
- **Training Logs**: Logged in users will be able to create daily training logs for each horse that will be stored in a journal. Approved "Trainers" will be able to submit comments and weekly and/or monthly training reports based on daily training logs.
- **Training Evaluations**: Logged in users will be able to upload videos of training sessions, with the option of attaching it to a training log. Approved "Trainers" will be able to submit an evaluation report based on the video, of strengths and weaknesses of both horse and rider during the session.
- **Training Goals**: Logged in users will be able to create short and long term training goals in a number of areas. Each goal can be linked to a training log and/or evaluation to track progress.
### Technologies
- C#
- XAML
- ASP.NET Core Web API Framework
- SQL Server 2019 Developer
- Xamarin.Forms
- Identity

This list is still in flux.
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to enable video, image, and file uploads in my application, possibly through the use of a third-party API or additional package. I also have not used Xamarin.Forms or XAML before, so the framework and language are entirely new to me.
